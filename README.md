# Pi-Client-Server
Used C, Raspberry Pi, vim, and command line to create a program that uses number of arguments to determine whether the user is the client or the server. The client uses their joystick to determine what color is displayed on the server's Raspberry Pi framebuffer. The server sends back what color was received from the client.
Created for CISC 210 (Introduction to Systems Programming) with Lauren Baron.
